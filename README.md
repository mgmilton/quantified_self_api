# Quantified Self API


Additional instructions for the project:
1. Open up a board on Pivotal Tracker and invite Sal (sal@turing.io) and myself (cory@turing.io) to be contributors
2. Before you begin to implement anything in regards to the project, write up 5-10 stories on your new Pivotal Tracker board. These stories must be written in present tense.
3. Once your team has completed step two, send your tracker board over to Sal and myself
4. For each story you create, there will be an associated story ID number. You'll use this for your pull requests
5. PR's must be formatted as the following: 123456: Add user to database table, 789101: Add get_all action for user resource, 194385: Add create action for user resource, etc
6. Copy and paste the story URL into the PR. Tag your PM in the PR as well. Feel free to merge once you have approval from your team. No need to have our approval unless there is a major issue that needs to be resolved.
7. Once you have run through and complete your original story list, write an additional 5-10 stories and send us a notification that they have been written. We'll be expecting to see consistent updates.
